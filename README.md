# CAT APP
An App That Displays Cat Images

Project Description:

For this coding assignment/ challenge, our Swift iOS Application must fetch a list of Cats from an API endpoint and display the downloaded data on a list.

Approach:

For the given limited time of 3 hours, I decided to stay focused on the main task, which is described in the above. So, knowing that my time is limited for creating this project, I decided to go with UIKit and the VIPER architectural design pattern.

Using VIPER, made the app more modular, and allowed me to focus on each part of the app individually, for example it allowed me to write separate/ better UnitTests for each individual component.

The assignment allowed me to use third party libraries, such as cocoa pods and swift packages, since this was a simple JSON parsing assignment, I decided to use just UIKit and Foundation.


To make the UI and UX a little more appealing, I decided to use a UICollectionView instead of a UITableView for displaying the Cat images.

Given the limited time, I tried to write efficient UnitTest, UITests. Of course  you can always aim for writing more UnitTest in different circumstances.

What what I do next:
I’d spend more time writing extra UnitTests/ UITests where possible
I’d try out SwiftUI and async await
